Crack MSCHAPv2/NTLMv1 challenge/responses quickly using a database of NT hashes
 
Introduction
 
Assless CHAPs is an efficient way to recover the NT hash used in a 
MSCHAPv2/NTLMv1 exchange if you have the challenge and response (e.g. from a 
WiFi EAP WPE attack).
 
It requires a database of NT hashes, instructions on how to make these from 
existing lists or using hashcat with wordlists and rules are available below. 
I've included a sample database from SecLists[3]. You'll need to bunzip it.
 
 
Technique
 
An MSCHAPv2 exchange does not require the clear-text password to be "cracked", 
rather we merely need the NThash used.
 
MSCHAPv2 splits the NThash into three parts, and uses each part as different 
keys to DES encrypt the same challenge (derived from the peer and authenticator 
challenges). The NTHash is split into two 7-byte keys, and one 2-byte key. This 
means the last key is padded with NULLs to make a key of the required length. 
This can be rapidly brute forced due to the efficiency of DES operation and a 
keyspace of 65 535. Once we have those two bytes, we can look up all NThashes in
our database, that end in those two bytes. This provides a much smaller set of 
possible hashes to check.
 
This is a form of space vs time tradeoff, similar to a rainbow table. It's also 
a form of hash shucking[4].
 
Presentation
 
This was first presented at Defcon 29's RF Hacking Village[5]. The slides are 
included in this repository.
 
Speed
 
Here is the comparison for three sample challenge/response's and three different
wordlists, a small private one, rockyou, and the Have I Been Pwned list. These 
were done on my Macbook Pro 2016. Hashcat is using this[6] hash schucking kernel
and the two builtin GPUs and a pure rather than optimised kernel (as the latter 
doesn't exist yet). Hash3 isn't in the lists to simulate worst case performance.
I'm not including the time hashcat takes to build the dictionary[7] cache on 
first run.
 
Hash1
 
Small hashlist:
 
hashcat 0.50s user 0.27s system 55% cpu 1.405 total (8597.8 kH/s)

Hash 3
 
Hash 3 doesn't exist in any of the hashlists to simulate a worst case lookup 
performance.

assless 0.06s user 0.03s system 115% cpu 0.075 total
 
 
Installing
 
The rust version will require SQLite 3.6.8 or newer.
 
The python version requires python3, sqlite3 and pycryptodome.
 
The database creation utility requires python3 and the sqlite3 CLI.
 
Compiling
 
This only applies to the rust version. You'll need cargo[8].
 
With cargo installed, merely change to the assless-chaps-rs directory, and build
it with: cargo build --release
 
The resulting binary will be in the target/release/ directory.
 
Usage
 
Assless requires the challenge, response and database of NThashes. Optionally, 
the python version can use the bundled optimised two byte lookup file. The 
simplest usage looks like this:
 
./assless-chaps <Challenge> <Response> <hashes.db>
 
or
 
python3 assless-chaps.py <Challenge> <Response> <hashes.db>
 
For example:
 
./assless-chaps 5d79b2a85966d347 
556fdda5f67d2b746ca3315fd8b93adcab5c792790a92e87 rockyou.db or python3 
assless-chaps.py 5d79b2a85966d347 
556fdda5f67d2b746ca3315fd8b93adcab5c792790a92e87 rockyou.db
 
The output should look like:
 
brute force instead. [+] Found in 22636 tries: 586c [-] Found 222 hashes ending 
in 586c [+] Found hash: 8846f7eaee8fb1 [-] Found after 186 hashes. [+] Found 
hash: 17ad06bdd830b7 [+] Full hash: 8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c ">
[-] Two byte lookup file not provided, will brute force instead.
[+] Found in 22636 tries: 586c
[-] Found 222 hashes ending in 586c
[+] Found hash: 8846f7eaee8fb1
[-] Found after 186 hashes.
[+] Found hash: 17ad06bdd830b7
[+] Full hash: 8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c
 
The final full hash 8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c is the NT hash for 
password.
 
Two bytes lookup - Python only for now
 
I spent some time building a list of all 65 535 possible two byte values sorted 
by most prevalent across a large corpus of passwords. This file is includes as 
twobytes. You can just pass it as the fourth argument to assless.
 
This typically saves a few rounds of DES, but doesn't make a large speed 
difference. It might if you're doing many hashes.
 
python3 assless-chaps.py 5d79b2a85966d347 
556fdda5f67d2b746ca3315fd8b93adcab5c792790a92e87 rockyou.db twobytes
 
[+] Found in 65533 tries: 586c
[-] Found 222 hashes ending in 586c
[+] Found hash: 8846f7eaee8fb1
[-] Found after 186 hashes.
[+] Found hash: 17ad06bdd830b7
[+] Full hash: 8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c
 
 
Creating your own hash dictionary
 
The mksqlitedb.py file will assist in turning a CSV hash file into the database.
 
python3 mksqlitedb.py <database name> <csv file>
 
The CSV file requires three columns:
 
  * The last two bytes of the hash (the last four ASCII characters)
  * The first 7 bytes (the first 14 ASCII characters)
  * The second 7 bytes (the 15-29th ASCII characters
 
For example, the hash 8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c will become:
 
586c,8846f7eaee8fb1,17ad06bdd830b7
 
An example regexp transformation for this would be: echo 
8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c | sed 
"s/^\(.\{14\}\)\(.\{14\}\)\(.\{4\}\)$/\3,\1,\2/"
 
You can either take an existing list of hashes (such as the Have I Been Pwned 
lists[9] or generate your own from hashcat and your favourite wordlist/rules 
combinations.
 
Using Have I Been Pwned
 
The HIBP password lists are already downloadable as NT Hashes, one just needs to
remove the count form the file and convert them to CSV format to be imported 
into the database.
 
This can be done using the standard Unix utility sed like so:
 
sed "s/^\(.\{14\}\)\(.\{14\}\)\(.\{4\}\):.*/\3,\1,\2/ 
pwned-passwords-ntlm-ordered-by-hash.txt" > hibp.csv
 
After which it can be imported using mksqlitedb.py hibp.db hibp.xsc.
 
Using hashcat to create a hash csv file from wordlists and rules
 
You'll need to make a small code change to the mode 1000 OpenCL module to make 
it spit out every hash, rather than only those matching your crack candidate. By
default, it will generate the hash in the right CSV format required.
 
  * Change to your hashcat OpenCL directory: cd hashcat/OpenCL
  * Apply the patch: patch < m01000_a0-pure.cl.patch
  * Prepare a file with an impossible to crack NT hash like echo 
  11111111111111111111111111111111 > impossible_hash
  * Crack as normal, but disable your potfile and redirect the output to a file:
  hashcat -m1000 impossible_hash rockyou.txt -r best64.rule --potfile-disable 
  --quiet > rockyou.csv
  * Create your hashes database: python3 mksqlitedb.py rockyou.db rockyou.csv
 
 
A note on disk space[10] and file sizes
 
The SQLite database is typically 61% larger that the CSV file used to create it.
It can also take some time to create the database depending on the size of 
files. Prepare your filesystem requirements[11] accordingly.
 
Here is an example using the rockyou dictionary:
 
  * Base rockyou dictionary 129M
  * hashcat generated rockyou.csv 462M
  * Resulting SQLite database rockyou.db 746M
  * BZip2 maximum compression rockyou.db.bz2 339M
 
You could save space by converting and inserting each hash dynamically and 
skipping the need for the intermediary CSV file.
 
NTLMv1 SSP
 
NTLMv1 will work in exactly the same way, unless it's using SSP. You'll know if 
SSP is in use if you get an LM response that ends in a bunch of zeros. You can 
use the included ntlm-ssp.py to produce the server challenge that assless will 
need.
 
Run it like this: python3 ntlm-ssp.py <lm response> <challenge>
 
For example if we use the example NTLMv1-SSP challenge response from the hashcat
example hashes[12]: u4-netntlm::kNS:338d08f8e26de9330000000000000000000000000000
0000:9526fb8c23a90751cdd619b6cea564742e1e4bf33006ba41:cb8086049ec4736c
 
You would pass in the LM and challenge like so:
 
python3 ntlm-ssp.py 338d08f8e26de93300000000000000000000000000000000 
cb8086049ec4736c
 
And get the following response:
 
The server challenge is: 724edf24aea0d68b
 
Which can then be cracked with assless-chaps like normal:
 
./assless-chaps 724edf24aea0d68b 
9526fb8c23a90751cdd619b6cea564742e1e4bf33006ba41 hashes.db
