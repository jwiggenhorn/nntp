OWASP Nettacker project is created to automate information gathering, 
vulnerability scanning[3] and eventually generating a report for networks, 
including services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other 
information. This software will utilize TCP SYN, ACK, ICMP, and many other 
protocols in order to detect and bypass Firewall/IDS/IPS devices. By leveraging 
a unique method in OWASP Nettacker for discovering protected services and 
devices such as SCADA. It would make a competitive edge compared to other 
scanner making it one of the bests.
