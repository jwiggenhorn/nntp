Enumerate Domain Data is designed to be similar to PowerView[3] but in .NET. 
PowerView is essentially the ultimate domain enumeration[4] tool, and we wanted 
a .NET implementation that we worked on ourselves. This tool was largely put 
together by viewing implementations of different functionality across a wide 
range of existing projects and combining them into EDD.
 
 
Usage
 
To use EDD, you just need to call the application, provide the function that you
want to run (listed below) and provide any optional/required parameters used by 
the function.
 
Functions
 
The following functions can be used with the -f flag to specify the data you 
want to enumerate/action you want to take.
 
Forest/Domain Information
 
getdomainsid - Returns the domain sid (by default current domain if no domain is
provided)
getforest - returns the name of the current forest
getforestdomains - returns the name of all domains in the current forest
convertsidtoname - Converts a SID to the corresponding group or domain name (use
the -u option for providing the SID value)
getadcsservers - Get a list of servers running AD CS within the current domain
 
 
Computer Information
 
getdomaincomputers - Get a list of all computers in the domain
getdomaincontrollers - Gets a list of all domain controllers
getdomainshares - Get a list of all accessible domain shares
 
 
User Information
 
remote system getnetdomaingroupmember - Returns a list of all users in a domain 
group getdomainuser - Retrieves info about specific user (name, description, 
SID, Domain Groups) getnetsession - Returns a list of accounts with sessions on 
the targeted system getnetloggedon - Returns a list of accounts logged into the 
targeted system getuserswithspns - Returns a list of all domain accounts that 
have a SPN[5] associated with them ">
getnetlocalgroupmember - Returns a list of all users in a local group on a 
remote system
getnetdomaingroupmember - Returns a list of all users in a domain group
getdomainuser - Retrieves info about specific user (name, description, SID, 
Domain Groups)
getnetsession - Returns a list of accounts with sessions on the targeted system
getnetloggedon - Returns a list of accounts logged into the targeted system
getuserswithspns - Returns a list of all domain accounts that have a SPN 
associated with them
 
 
Chained Information
 
finddomainprocess - Search for a specific process across all systems in the 
domain (requires admin access on remote systems)
finddomainuser - Searches the domain environment for a specified user or group 
and tries to find active sessions (default searches for Domain Admins)
findinterestingdomainsharefile - Searches the domain environment for all 
accessible shares. Once found, it parses all filenames for "interesting" strings
findwritableshares - Enumerates all shares in the domain and then checks to see 
if the current account can create a text file in the root level share, and one 
level deep.
