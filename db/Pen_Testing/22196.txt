This tool compiles some necessary tools for wifi auditing[4] in a unix bash 
script with a user friendly[5] interface. The goal of owt is to have the 
smallest file size possible while still functioning at maximum proficiency.

~ $ git clone https://github.com/clu3bot/OWT.git
~ $ cd owt
~ $ sudo bash owt.sh

In The Works
 
  * Expanding owt from being just for wireless[8] network attacking. More 
  information below.
  * Adding more advanced functionality to owt such as NTP amplification attacks 
  to screw with NTP servers for dosing websites.
  * Adding AP tracking[9] functionality and ability to save lists of common 
  saved networks that devices have in the area. I.E if there is a starbucks near
  by you can track if starbucks is a common AP that phones in the area have as a
  saved network. This is useful for knowing which APs to spoof.
  * Adding a method of saving text or csv files of device names and 
  mac-addresses on a newtwork.
  * Making a windows version of owt.
  * Major U.I changes
  * Fixing the "issue" where owt doesn't support use within Virtual Machines. 
  Not priority as this is a pain in the ass but has been requested :)
