Visualizations can inspire creative new ways of thinking about an object. But 
holding that visualization in your hand adds a whole other level of impact to 
it. That desire for impact has led Dr. Nia Imara, an astrophysicist and artist 
at UC Santa Cruz[1], to create the first-ever 3D printed models of stellar 
nurseries.
 
The printed spheres are more than just fancy baseball-sized marbles. Their 
strands of different colorations represent the filaments and clumps of material 
naturally found in star-forming regions in space. Dr. Imara worked with John 
Forbes at the Flatiron Institute’s[2] Center for Computational Astrophysics and 
James Weaver at Harvard[3] to develop a suite of nine different models of the 
three forces that impact how stellar nurseries forms: turbulence, gravity, and 
magnetic fields.

Different patterns in the final marbles represent variations in those three 
forces. The added benefit of a third dimension of visualization allowed 
researchers to understand how those forces interact in ways never before 
considered. Lighter areas correspond to dense clumps of gas and dust, whereas 
the darker swirls represent the void of space itself.
 
Those intricate swirls resulted from a type of inkjet-like 3D printing[5] 
process, which differs from the typical extrusion processes a standard desktop 
3D printer uses. It uses tiny drops of resin precisely deposited at certain 
locations to create the swirling, whimsical effects seen in the models.

While undeniably pretty to look at, the structures themselves are also 
interesting from a scientific perspective. Understanding how the filaments and 
clumps in the model interact based on the three forces is much easier to see 
when looking at a print of their shape rather than at data on a computer screen.
Additionally, some of the models were left half-completed, allowing scientists 
to look at a cross-section of what the inside of the nurseries would look like 
according to the model.
 
While science was certainly a driving force in the research, Dr. Imara mentioned
a particular portrait she drew of herself grasping a star that made her 
originally conceive of this project. But she very easily could have been 
inspired by an older pop culture reference – spoilers for a 25-year-old movie 
ahead. In the original Men In Black, the heroes realize that what looks like a 
sphere on the cat Orion’s belt is actually a whole universe contained in the 
size of a marble. While not quite that intricately detailed, Dr. Imara’s 3D 
printed models of stellar nurseries are the closest humanity has come to 
creating something like that for ourselves – and they are absolutely 
breathtaking.
