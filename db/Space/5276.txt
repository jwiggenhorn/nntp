NASA is a sprawling organization that has to talk to everything from politicians
in Washington DC to space probes that have left the solar system[1]. Discussions
with the first might be as simple as a written letter for informal conversation,
while the second requires a high-power network of ground-based antennas. Known 
as the Deep Space Network (DSN[2]) this series of antennas spread over three 
continents is the backbone of NASA’s communications with its various space 
probes[3]. Now the DSN is in the process of implementing a well-deserved 
upgrade.
 
Part of the reason for that upgrade is the sheer number of spacecraft in deep 
space NASA has to communicate with. Everything from Voyager[4] to the Parker 
Solar Probe[5] requires time on the antenna to relay data and receive 
instructions. But with new missions launching at an increasing pace, the network
must be beefed up in order to accommodate all the new communication links.

Currently, DSN supports 39 missions, but NASA has 30 additional missions in 
development, and not all of the existing missions will be phased out in the near
future. To ensure consistent communication no matter where the Earth is on its 
journey around the sun, the antennas supporting those 30 missions are evenly 
spread around the globe – in Madrid, Spain, Canberra, Australia, and near 
Barstow California. When not being used for communication directly, the antennas
can serve as data collection platforms for radio science missions[7] as well.
 
One major component of the upgrade needed to support all this work is the 
addition of 2 new antennas. The first, a 34-m wide dish named DSS-56 was 
commissioned in Madrid in January of this year. Also completed this year was an 
upgrade to DSS-43, a 70-m antenna located in Australia that is the only antenna 
in the Southern Hemisphere that is capable of sending messages to Voyager, which
is currently outside of our solar system.

DSS-43 won’t be the last 70-m antenna improvement either – its equivalents in 
Madrid and California are slated to receive upgrades soon as well. Increasing 
the power of those antennas isn’t their only purpose. With so much additional 
data being sent between handlers and spacecraft, increasing data transfer rates 
is another focal point of the network upgrades. Eliminating frequency bands that
specific telescopes are limited to will help the network utilize all of its 
resources to support all of its missions. 
 
Not only is the DSN[9] getting technological upgrades, but it’s also trying a 
new management system that will better utilize the three sites spread throughout
the world. Previously, on-site managers had managed the antennas at their site 
locally. Now, there is a global hand-off protocol that managers call “Follow the
Sun”, which allows personnel at each complex to run their entire network during 
their own “on” shift. This has created cost savings as well as increased 
coordination between the sites as it requires regular knowledge transfer about 
local conditions and satellite quirks.

A lot of those cost savings from the new management architecture have gone into 
technological upgrades for the antennas themselves. With the pace of 
technological advancement in the communications field, there is plenty of room 
for improvement, but NASA has already shown that maintaining and even upgrading 
their internal communication network is one of the priorities.
