The Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) is a different kind of radio telescope. Although
radio light has the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies of the 
electromagnetic spectrum, much of radio astronomy has focused on the higher 
frequency end. Observatories such as ALMA study radio light at frequencies of 
hundreds of Gigahertz, and the VLA studies the fifty Gigahertz range, LOFAR 
captures radio signals below 250 Megahertz, which is in the range of the lowest 
radio frequencies that can be seen from Earth.

Low-frequency radio astronomy is challenging because astronomical radio sources 
are very faint. Low-frequency light also has a longer wavelength, which means 
that it is hard to capture radio images with good resolution. To overcome these 
challenges, LOFAR uses an array of omnidirectional antennas. It has about 20,000
antennas clustered at 52 stations across Europe. Together they create a virtual 
telescope more than 1,000 kilometers across. With such a large number of 
antennas, processing the data is extremely complex. Other radio telescopes also 
combine multiple signals from an antenna array, but LOFAR operates at such low 
frequencies that Earth’s ionosphere can distort the signals. It’s similar to the
way visible light can be distorted when viewed through ripples of water. So 
powerful new software had to be developed to convert the radio data into images 
of the sky.
 
Recently, LOFAR released the first data on its Long Baseline Array Sky Survey. 
They have only mapped 4% of the northern sky so far, but have already mapped 
25,000 supermassive black holes. While the universe is filled with radio 
sources, most low-frequency radio light comes from concentrated sources such as 
black holes at the hearts of galaxies. LOFAR has a high enough resolution that 
the black hole map looks like a starry night, with each black hole as an 
isolated radio dot, as you can see in the image above.
 
It will take several more years for the team to make a full map of the northern 
sky. When completed, the sky survey could help us learn not only about black 
holes but also about the large-scale structure of the cosmos.
