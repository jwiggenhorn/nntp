Roughly a century ago, scientists began to realize that some of the radiation we
detect in Earth’s atmosphere is not local in origin. This eventually gave rise 
to the discovery of cosmic rays, high-energy protons and atomic nuclei that have
been stripped of their electrons and accelerated to relativistic speeds (close 
to the speed of light). However, there are still several mysteries surrounding 
this strange (and potentially lethal) phenomenon. 
 
This includes questions about their origins[1] and how the main component of 
cosmic rays (protons) are accelerated to such high velocity. Thanks to new 
research led by the University of Nagoya, scientists have quantified the amount 
of cosmic rays produced in a supernova remnant for the first time. This research
has helped resolve a 100-year mystery and is a major step towards determining 
precisely where cosmic rays come from.
 
While scientists theorize that cosmic rays originate from many sources – our 
Sun, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and Active Galactic Nuclei[2] (aka. 
quasars) – their exact origin has been a mystery since they were first 
discovered in 1912. Similarly, astronomers have theorized that supernova 
remnants (the after-effects of supernova explosions) are responsible for 
accelerating them to nearly the speed of light.

As they travel through our galaxy, cosmic rays play a role in the chemical 
evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM). As such, understanding their origin 
is critical to understanding how galaxies evolve. In recent years, improved 
observations have led some scientists to speculate that supernova remnants give 
rise to cosmic rays because the protons they accelerate interact with protons in
the ISM to create very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays.
 
However, gamma-rays are also produced by electrons that interact with photons in
the ISM, which can be in the form of infrared photons or radiation from the 
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Therefore, determining which source is 
greater is paramount to determining the origin of cosmic rays. Hoping to shed 
light on this, the research team – which included members from Nagoya 
University, the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan[4] (NAOJ), and the 
University of Adelaide, Australia – observed the supernova remnant RX 
J1713.7?3946 (RX J1713). 
 
The key to their research was the novel approach they developed to quantify the 
source of gamma-rays in interstellar space. Past observations have shown that 
the intensity of VHE gamma-rays caused by protons colliding with other protons 
in the ISM is proportional to the interstellar gas density, which is discernible
using radio-line imaging. On the other hand, gamma-rays caused by the 
interaction of electrons with photons in the ISM are also expected to be 
proportional to the intensity of nonthermal X-rays from electrons.
 
For the sake of their study, the team relied on data obtained by the High Energy
Stereoscopic System (HESS), a VHE gamma-ray observatory located in Namibia (and 
operated by the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics). They then combined 
this with X-ray data obtained by the ESA’s X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission 
(XMM-Newton) observatory and data on the distribution of gas in the interstellar
medium.

They then combined all three data sets and determined that protons account for 
67 ± 8% of cosmic rays while cosmic-ray electrons account for 33 ± 8% – roughly 
a 70/30 split. These findings are groundbreaking since they are the first time 
that the possible origins of cosmic rays have been quantified. They also 
constitute the most definitive evidence to date that supernova remnants are the 
source of cosmic rays. 
 
These results also demonstrate that gamma-rays from protons are more common in 
gas-rich interstellar regions, whereas those caused by electrons are enhanced in
the gas-poor regions. This supports what many researchers have predicted, which 
is that the two mechanisms work together to influence the evolution of the ISM. 
Said[6] Emeritus Professor Yasuo Fukui, who was the study’s lead author:
 
  “This novel method could not have been accomplished without international 
  collaborations. [It] will be applied to more supernova remnants using the 
  next-generation gamma-ray telescope CTA (Cherenkov Telescope Array) in 
  addition to the existing observatories, which will greatly advance the study 
  of the origin of cosmic rays.”
 
In addition to leading this project, Fukui has been working to quantify 
interstellar gas distribution since 2003 using the NANTEN[7] radio telescope at 
the Las Campanas Observatory[8] in Chile and the Australia Telescope Compact 
Array[9]. Thanks to Professor Gavin Rowell and Dr. Sabrina Einecke of the 
University of Adelaide (co-authors on the study) and the H.E.S.S. team, the 
spatial resolution and sensitivity of gamma-ray observatories has finally 
reached the point where it is possible to draw comparisons between the two.
 
Meanwhile, co-author Dr. Hidetoshi Sano of the NAOJ led the analysis of archival
datasets from the XMM-Newton observatory. In this respect, this study also shows
how international collaborations and data-sharing are enabling all kinds of 
cutting-edge research. Along with improved instruments, improved methods and 
greater opportunities for cooperation are leading to an age where astronomical 
breakthroughs are becoming a regular occurrence!
