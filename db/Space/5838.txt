Beyond Earth, the general scientific consensus is that the best place to search 
for evidence of extraterrestrial life is Mars. However, it is by no means the 
only place. Aside from the many extrasolar planets that have been designated as 
“potentially-habitable,” there are plenty of other candidates right here in our 
Solar System. These include the many icy satellites that are thought to have 
interior oceans that could harbor life.
 
Among them is Titan, Saturn’s largest moon that has all kinds of organic 
chemistry taking place between its atmosphere and surface. For some time, 
scientists have suspected that the study of Titan’s atmosphere could yield vital
clues to the early stages of the evolution of life on Earth. Thanks to new 
research led by tech-giant IBM[1], a team of researchers has managed to recreate
atmospheric conditions on Titan in a laboratory.
 
Their research is described in a paper titled “Imaging Titan’s Organic Haze at 
Atomic Scale[2],” which recently appeared in the Feb. 12^th issue of The 
Astrophysical Journal Letters. The research team was led by Dr. Fabian Schulz 
and Dr. Julien Maillard and included many colleagues from IBM 
Research-Zurich[3], the University of Paris-Saclay[4], the University of Rouen 
at Mont-Saint-Aignan[5], and Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society[6].

Much of what we know about Titan today is owed to the Cassini spacecraft[8], 
which orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017 and finished its mission by diving into 
Saturn’s atmosphere. During this time, Cassini conducted many direct 
measurements of Titan’s atmosphere, revealing a surprisingly Earth-like 
environment. Basically, Titan is the only other body in the Solar System that 
has a dense nitrogen atmosphere and organic processes taking place.
 
What is particularly interesting is the fact that scientists believe that 
roughly 2.8 billion years ago, Earth’s atmosphere may have been similar. This 
coincides with the Mesoarchean Era[9], a period where photosynthetic 
cyanobacteria created the first reef systems and slowly converted Earth’s 
atmospheric carbon dioxide to oxygen gas (eventually leading to its current 
balance of nitrogen and oxygen).
 
While the surface of Titan is believed to hold clues that could improve our 
understanding of how life emerged in our Solar System, getting a clear look at 
that surface has been a problem. The reason for this has to do with Titan’s 
atmosphere, which is permeated by a dense photochemical haze that scatters 
light. As Leo Gross[10] and Nathalie Carrasco[11] (co-authors on the study) 
explained in recent article posted to the IBM Research Blog[1]:
 
  “Titan’s haze consists of nanoparticles made of a wide variety of large and 
  complex organic molecules containing carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen. These 
  molecules form in a cascade of chemical reactions when (ultraviolet and 
  cosmic) radiation hits the mix of methane, nitrogen and other gases in 
  atmospheres like Titan’s.”

As a result, there is still much that scientists don’t know about the processes 
that drive Titan’s atmosphere, which includes the exact chemical structure of 
the large molecules that make up this haze. For decades, astrochemists have been
conducting laboratory experiments with similar organic molecules known as 
tholins – a term derived from the Greek word for “muddy” (or “hazy”).
 
Tholins refer to a wide variety of organic carbon-containing compounds that form
when exposed to solar UV or cosmic rays. These molecules are common in the outer
Solar System and are typically found in icy bodies, where the surface layer 
contains methane ice that is exposed to radiation. Their presence is indicated 
by surface that have a ruddy appearance, or like they have sepia-colored stains.
 
For the sake of their study, the team led by Schulz and Maillard conducted a 
experiment where they observed tholins in various stages of formation in a 
laboratory environment. As Gross and Carrasco explained[1]:
 
  “We flooded a stainless-steel vessel with a mixture of methane and nitrogen 
  and then triggered chemical reactions through an electric discharge, thereby 
  mimicking the conditions in Titan’s atmosphere. We then analyzed over 100 
  resulting molecules composing Titan’s tholins in our lab at Zurich, obtaining 
  atomic resolution images of around a dozen of them with our home-built 
  low-temperature atomic force microscope.”

By resolving molecules of different sizes, the team was provided with glimpses 
of the different stages through which these haze molecules grow, as well as what
their chemical makeup looks like. In essence, they observed a key component in 
Titan’s atmosphere as it formed and accumulated to create Titan’s famous hazy 
effect. Said[1] Conor A. Nixon[14], a researcher with NASA’s Goddard Space 
Flight Center (who was not affiliated with the study):
 
  “This paper shows ground-breaking new work in the use of atomic-scale 
  microscopy to investigate the structures of complex, multi-ringed organic 
  molecules. Typical analysis of laboratory-generated compounds using techniques
  such as mass spectroscopy reveals the relative proportions of the various 
  elements, but not the chemical bonding and structure. 
 
  “For this first time here we see the molecular architecture of synthetic 
  compounds similar to those thought to cause the orange haze of Titan’s 
  atmosphere. This application now provides an exciting new tool for sample 
  analysis of astrobiological materials, including meteorites and returned 
  samples from planetary bodies.”
 
What’s more, their results may also shed light on Titan’s mysterious 
methane-based hydrological cycle. On Earth, this cycle consists of water 
transitioning between a gaseous state (water vapor) and a liquid state (rain and
surface water). On Titan, the same cycle takes place with methane, which 
transitions from atmospheric methane gas and falls as methane rain to form 
Titan’s famous hydrocarbon lakes.

In this case, the research team’s results could reveal the role that the 
chemical haze plays in Titan’s methane cycle, including whether or not these 
nanoparticles can float on its methane lakes. Furthermore, these findings could 
reveal whether or not similar atmospheric aerosols helped life emerge on Earth 
billions of years ago. 
 
“The molecular structures we have now imaged are known to be good absorbers of 
ultraviolet light,” described[1] Gross and Carrasco. “That, in turn, means that 
the haze may have acted as a shield protecting DNA molecules on the early 
Earth’s surface from damaging radiation.”
 
If this theory is correct, the team’s findings would not only help scientists to
understand the conditions under which life emerged here on Earth, they could 
also point towards the possible existence of life on Titan. The mysterious 
nature of this satellite is something scientists first became aware of in the 
early 1980s, when the Voyager 1 and 2[16] space probes both flew through the 
Saturn system. Since then, scientists have pieced together 
 
By the 2030s, NASA plans to send a robotic rotorcraft called Dragonfly[17] to 
Titan to explore its surface and atmosphere and search for possible signs of 
life. As always, the theoretical work and laboratory experiments performed in 
the meantime will allow scientists to narrow the focus and increase the odds 
that the mission (once it arrives) will find what its looking for.
