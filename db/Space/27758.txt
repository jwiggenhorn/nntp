Extreme winter weather hit Texas hard this February. An air mass from the arctic
extended deep into the United States from Canada, with disastrous results for 
the ordinarily warm state. Along with snow and unusually low temperatures, the 
state’s capacity for power generation was significantly reduced by 
weather-related equipment failures. Images[1] hosted by NASA’s Earth 
Observatory[2] show the effect of controlled, rolling blackouts across the 
Greater Houston Area. 
 
One image, taken on February 7th, shows Houston before the arctic weather 
system, and another picture taken on the 16th shows large swaths of the city in 
darkness. Earth Observatory has conveniently layered the two images with a 
vertical slider allowing users to slide back and forth, highlighting (or 
low-lighting as it were) the blackouts’ impact.

weather. The right shows the effects of rolling blackouts on the 16th. Check out

Each of these images is composed of nighttime lights data overlaid on Landsat[4]
imagery to allow the city structure to be recognizable under the lights. The 
nighttime lights data is from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite[5] 
or VIIRS. This instrumentation suite rides aboard the Suomi National 
Polar-Orbiting Partnership[6] (Suomi NPP) spacecraft. 
 
VIIRS data is also utilized in NASA’s Black Marble[7], a program studying the 
Earth at night. Nighttime lights data is collected and processed by Black Marble
in a variety of situations and for various events, such as the 2019 Hurricane 
Dorian’s devastating impact on the Bahamas.[8]

Along with the February 2021 images of rolling blackouts in Texas, the Earth 
Observatory published a global temperature map focused on North America for 
February 15. In this dramatic image, the extent of the extreme cold of the 
arctic air mass can be seen carving through the heart of the continent. Dallas 
recorded a chilling temperature of a mere -16°C (4°F), which is lower than most 
of the high temperatures recorded at Gale Crater on Mars[10] by the Curiosity 
Rover!

For those fascinated by satellite imagery of the earth, it is worth digging 
deeper into what Earth Observatory is up to. For instance, users can explore 
this extraordinary global map[12]. It features spectacular images and the 
associated stories for points around the world. Thousands of interactive points 
allow you to explore unbelievably detailed satellite images for hours and hours.
If you have a habit of falling down Wikipedia rabbit holes, this will surely 
scratch a similar itch.

The side-by-side imagery of Houston’s power outages highlights the importance of
scientific instrumentation in orbit pointed back home. When some people think 
about the space program, interplanetary missions like Mars Perseverance or 
cosmic observers like the Hubble Space Telescope often get the vast bulk of 
their attention. While Perseverance and Hubble are undoubtedly remarkable and 
valuable programs, we often overlook the significance of Earth-focused missions.
When was the last time you saw a big news headline about the Suomi National 
Polar-Orbiting Partnership, let alone VIIRS? Programs like this are deserving of
support and praise. There’s something compelling about seeing such breathtaking 
images of our world, and the value of the scientific understanding that comes 
along with it is immeasurable.
