Microsoft on Wednesday said it remediated a vulnerability in its Azure Container
Instances (ACI) services that could have been exploited by a malicious actor "to
access other customers' information" in what the researcher described as the 
"first cross-account container takeover in the public cloud." An attacker 
exploiting the weakness could execute malicious commands on other users' 
containers,[image 1 (link #1)]
