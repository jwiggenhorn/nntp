Starting next week, New York City will begin enforcing a requirement of at least
one COVID-19 vaccine shot for entrance to businesses like restaurants, bars, 
museums, theaters and gyms. That’s easier said than done, however, as customers 
struggle to navigate apps and business owners attempt to verify vaccine statuses
and enforce the mandate. Plus: Record-number job openings are met with a “meh” 
number of hires, how North Dakota is aiming to distribute rent relief and more 
Americans look to retire at a younger age.
